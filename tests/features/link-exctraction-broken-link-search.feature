Feature: link extraction and broken link search
    As a tester I want to search through the site as a logged in user,
    listing all the links in the website and all of its child sites in the same domain.

    Rule: all the <a> tags should be collected on a site

    Rule: If a link is not saved yet in our link database, save it

    Rule: exercise every link, collect their status code and response time
